## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello there! My real name is Adel, and online I am known as playXE or playX18. The story behind name change is simple: I lost my 2FA codes for recovery of my original GH at [playXE](https://github.com/playxe). All my hobby projects are now developed on my self-hosted git: [git.playxe.org](https://git.playxe.org/playXE) or in this GH. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [gear](https://github.com/gear-tech/gear) and [vmkit-core](https://git.playxe.org/playXE/vmkit-core)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning self-hosting, docker, and kubernetes
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on [vmkit-core](https://git.playxe.org/playXE/vmkit-core)
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with [vmkit-core](https://git.playxe.org/playXE/vmkit-core)
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything! Or language development...
